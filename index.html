  		<h1>Introduction</h1>
  		<p>As fate would have it, I was born at the brink of the Digital Age. I carry the ambitious soul of a dreamer. A bit of a perfectionist, and that sometimes drives me crazy. My demeanor is somewhat calm and collective, but that's only because I'm a thinker.</p>
  		<p>What's important to me are relationships. It was once said that the quality of your <em><b>life</em></b> is the quality of your <em><b>relationships</b>.</em> Wouldn't you agree?</p>

  		<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  		<p>I'm from the concrete jungle where dreams are made of. There aren't many things you can't do in this melting pot. These streets will make you feel brand new, and these lights will inspire you. I'm from New York City.</p>

  		<h1>More About Me</h1>
  		<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  		<p>My hobbies consist of studying and training Krav Maga, the official self defense system of Israel. Listening to good music. Eating at casual restaurants with my sweetheart. And watching highly anticipated boxing and/or UFC fights with my comrades.</p>
 		 <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  		<p>My dream job would have me anxious to wake up in the morning. I would start my day at my own pace and work off my own schedule. Stress free environment. More importantly, it would be rewarding and lucrative. I have yet to find this dream job, but I’d come pretty close as a freelance Web Developer… or maybe If I worked for Google.</p>
 		 <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  		<p>Currently in my playlist, I have “Distant Relatives” (a collaborative album by rapper Nas and reggae artist Damian Marley). I also have been enjoying the voice and songs of Sam Smith.</p>
